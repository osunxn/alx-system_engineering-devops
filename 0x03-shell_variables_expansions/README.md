# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project covers the topic of Shell scripting, init files, variables, and expansions. It aims to provide a better understanding of how to write shell scripts, configure initialization files, and utilize variables and expansions effectively.

## Files

The project consists of several scripts and files, each serving a specific purpose. Here is an overview of the files in this project:

- `script1.sh`: This script demonstrates basic shell scripting concepts, including executing commands and variable assignments.

- `script2.sh`: This script showcases the usage of conditional statements, such as if-else and case statements.

- `init_file`: This file represents a sample initialization file and illustrates how to configure environment variables.

- `expansion_example.sh`: This script demonstrates various types of expansions, including parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and more.

## Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Shell: Bash

## Usage

To execute the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the desired script using the command `./script1.sh` (replace `script1.sh` with the appropriate script name).

Ensure that the script files have executable permissions. If not, you can set the permissions using the command `chmod +x script1.sh` (replace `script1.sh` with the appropriate script name).

## Notes

- The scripts provided are for educational purposes. It is recommended to understand the commands and verify the actions before executing them on critical systems.

- Feel free to modify and experiment with the scripts to enhance your learning experience.
