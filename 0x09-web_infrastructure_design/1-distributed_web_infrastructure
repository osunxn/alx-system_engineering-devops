Components:

Domain Name (www.foobar.com): Represents the human-readable address used by users to access the website.

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers to ensure no
single server bears too much load. It enhances fault tolerance and ensures high availability.

Web Server (Nginx): Serves static content, manages SSL/TLS, and acts as a reverse proxy to
forward requests to the application server.

Application Server: Hosts the application logic and processes dynamic content. It communicates
with the database to retrieve and store data.

Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data. In this case, it's set up as a
Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for redundancy.

Primary Node: Handles write operations and serves as the main node for data modifications.

Replica Nodes: Replicate data from the primary node and handle read operations.
They act as backups in case the primary node fails.

Distribution Algorithm:

The load balancer is configured with a Round Robin algorithm, distributing incoming
requests equally among the available servers.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

The setup is Active-Active, where both servers actively handle incoming traffic.
This ensures optimal resource utilization and redundancy.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The load balancer, web server, and application server could be
potential SPOFs if any of them fails.

Security Issues:

No firewall: Lack of a firewall exposes servers to potential security threats.

No HTTPS: Lack of HTTPS encryption poses a security risk for data transmission.

No Monitoring: Without a monitoring system, it's challenging to identify performance bottlenecks,
potential failures, or security breaches.
