Components:

Load Balancers (Load Balancer 1, Load Balancer 2): Load balancers are added to distribute incoming traffic evenly
among multiple servers. They enhance scalability, improve fault tolerance, and optimize resource utilization.

Web Server (Web Server): The web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) handles static content, serves as a reverse proxy,
and manages SSL termination for secure communication.

Application Servers (Application Server 1, Application Server 2, Application Server 3): Application servers host
the application logic, handle dynamic content generation, and process user requests. Distributing the load across
multiple application servers improves performance and reliability.

Database Server (Database Server): The database server stores and manages data. It is separate from other components
for scalability, data integrity, and to prevent bottlenecks.

Specifics:

Why Load Balancers: Load balancers distribute incoming traffic, ensuring high availability, redundancy, and improved
performance. They also enable easy scalability by adding more servers.

Why Web Server: The web server handles static content, manages SSL termination, and acts as a reverse proxy.
This separation allows for efficient handling of web-related tasks.

Why Application Servers: Application servers host the application logic and process dynamic content. Multiple
application servers distribute the load, provide redundancy, and enhance responsiveness.

Why Database Server: The database server stores and manages data. Separating it from other servers ensures data
integrity, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The load balancers themselves may become a single point of failure. Configuring
them in a cluster enhances reliability.

Security: Ensure proper security measures for communication between components, secure configurations, and regular
updates.
