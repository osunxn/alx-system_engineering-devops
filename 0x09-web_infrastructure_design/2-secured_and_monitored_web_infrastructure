Components:


Firewalls (Firewall 1, Firewall 2, Firewall 3): Firewalls are added to control incoming and outgoing network traffic
based on predetermined security rules. They act as barriers between the server infrastructure and potential threats.

Load Balancer (Load Balancer): Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers for load balancing and
high availability.

Web Server (Web Server): Serves static content and manages SSL/TLS, providing encrypted traffic to users.
Application Servers (Application Server 1, Application Server 2, Application Server 3):Host the application logic, 
process dynamic content, and communicate with the database.

Database (MySQL): Stores and manages website data securely. Set up as a cluster for redundancy and distributed load.

Monitoring Clients (Monitoring Client 1, Monitoring Client 2, Monitoring Client 3, Monitoring Client 4, Monitoring
Client 5): Collect data on server performance, security, and other metrics for monitoring purposes.

Specifics:

Why Firewalls: Protect against unauthorized access, secure the network, and filter traffic based on security rules.

Why HTTPS: Serves encrypted traffic to protect data during transmission, enhancing security.

Why Monitoring: Monitors server performance, identifies issues, and ensures the health and availability of the
infrastructure.

How Monitoring Tool Collects Data: The monitoring tool collects data through agents (Monitoring Clients)
installed on each server. These agents collect and send performance metrics and logs to a central monitoring service.

Monitoring Web Server QPS: To monitor Web Server QPS, set up specific metrics in the monitoring tool to
track queries per second (QPS) on the web server.

Issues:

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level: Terminating SSL at the load balancer means SSL decryption
happens at the load balancer, which may expose sensitive information. It's better to use end-to-end encryption.

Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes: A single MySQL server capable of accepting writes is a single point of
failure (SPOF). Consider a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) configuration for high availability.

Identical Server Components: Having servers with all the same components may lead to a lack of
diversity and could be problematic for security. Different components may have different vulnerabilities,
and diversity can enhance security.

This infrastructure provides enhanced security, encryption, and monitoring, but continuous improvements
and adjustments are essential for maintaining a robust and secure environment.
