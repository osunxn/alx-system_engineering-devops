Components:

Server:

Definition: A physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.
Role: Hosts the web server, application server, and database components.
Web Server (Nginx):

Definition: A web server software that serves static content and handles incoming HTTP requests.
Role: Responsible for serving static files, managing connections, and directing dynamic requests
to the application server.

Application Server:

Definition: Executes the application code, processes business logic, and generates dynamic content.
Role: Handles dynamic parts of the website, interacts with the database, and generates HTML dynamically.

Application Files (Code Base):

Definition: The collection of source code, scripts, and assets that make up the website's application.
Role: Contains the logic and functionalities that define the behavior of the website.

Database (MySQL):

Definition: A relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and manages data.
Role: Stores and retrieves data for the website, such as user information, articles, or any other relevant data.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

Definition: A human-readable name that maps to the server's IP address.
Role: Allows users to access the website using a memorable domain name instead of an IP address.
Specifics:

What is a Server:

A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or functionalities to
other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Role of the Domain Name:

A domain name provides a human-readable alias for the server's IP address,
making it easier for users to access the website.

Type of DNS Record for www.foobar.com:

The DNS record type for www.foobar.com is an A (Address) record, mapping the domain to
the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

Role of the Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) serves static content, handles HTTP requests, and forwards dynamic 
requests to the application server.

Role of the Application Server:

The application server executes dynamic code, processes business logic, and generates dynamic content
in response to user requests.

Role of the Database (MySQL):

The database (MySQL) stores and manages data, providing a structured way to organize and retrieve information.

Server Communication with User's Computer:

The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the
HTTP/HTTPS protocols, responding to requests and serving content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, leading to a SPOF. If the server goes down,
the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime During Maintenance:

Performing maintenance, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server,
results in downtime, impacting user access.

Limited Scalability:

The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic since scaling is limited to a single server.
As traffic increases, performance may degrade.

This simple web stack serves as a starting point but has limitations in terms of reliability, scalability,
and maintainability. Addressing these issues may involve introducing redundancy, load balancing,
and distributed architectures.
